Slowly more complexity has been added for further functionality, ie. scrolling of channel frames.  Should be extrapolated into a more complex struct, but I wanted to maintain the simplicity of map[string]Channel  so that it wouldn't be in the least bit daunting to think of this.
The frivilous complexity has arisen due to map locks and shoehorning channel scrolling without changing the code's structure.
